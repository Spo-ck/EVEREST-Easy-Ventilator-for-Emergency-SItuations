# EVEREST Easy Ventilator for Emergency Situations

Welcome to the EVEREST - Easy Ventilator for Emergency Use. This documentation wil be enhanced in the upcomming weeks into a tutorial on how to built a ventilator. 

On the IT Side, Everest consists out of a Microcontroller (ESP32) that controlls the Ventilation, and a Raspberry Pi that is hosting the GUI. The Gui is hosted in the Open Source Application Node-Red that has to be installed on the Rasperry Pi. The Raspberry Pis is then connected to the Microcontroller via USB. The Controller itself is flashed using the Arduino IDE.
